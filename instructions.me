SilcsBio Candidate Exercise Instructions
Interactive Visualization Demo for P38 MAP Kinase (PDB: 3FLY) Using SILCS FragMaps
Repository Name Requirement: silcs-fragmaps-demo
1. Overview
As part of the next stage of our interview process, you will build a small interactive demo that visualizes:
● The P38 MAP Kinase protein (PDB 3FLY)
● SILCS FragMaps provided by SilcsBio
● Multiple ligands scored using SILCS‑MC Pose Refinement
● A clear, concise scientific narrative that explains the key interaction features
This exercise is designed to assess your ability to combine scientific understanding, front‑end
development, and communication in a lightweight prototype similar to the current interactive demo on
the silcsbio.com website. You may also refer to a video tutorial for visualizing SILCS FragMaps in SilcsBio
GUI here: https://docs.silcsbio.com/2025/videotutorials.html#
2. Required Repository Setup
Before starting:
1. Create a public GitHub repository named silcs-fragmaps-demo and in configuration add
license type: MIT License.
2. Add aakognole as a collaborator with write access. We will upload input files along with a
README.md file with information on each input file.
3. What You Need to Build
Your interactive demo should include the following elements.
2
A. Overview / Introduction Page
Provide a short, readable explanation covering:
● What P38 MAP Kinase is (biological role)
● The crystal ligand(s) being shown
● What SILCS FragMaps represent
● Why FragMaps help interpret ligand binding
● What the user can do or explore in the demo
This should be concise, 1–2 paragraphs are enough.
B. Interactive Visualization Page (Required)
Use an open‑source web-based 3D visualization library of your choice.
Examples include:
● Mol* (https://molstar.org)
● 3Dmol.js (https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu)
● LiteMol
● NGL Viewer
Your viewer must support:
● Loading the 3FLY PDB structure
● Showing different bound ligand(s) or the SILCS‑MC refined ligand poses
● Loading and overlaying SILCS FragMaps
● Basic user controls such as:
○ Show/hide individual FragMap surfaces
○ Adjust view (rotate, translate, zoom etc)
○ Adjust iso‑value (slider or preset levels) if possible
Include a simple caption or sidebar describing what the user is seeing.
C. Navigation / Structure
At minimum, your demo should offer:
● Home / Overview
● Interactive Viewer
3
4. Technical Requirements
● The website must run entirely client‑side. You may use any free hosting provider, such as: GitHub
Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render etc. Static hosting is sufficient; no backend services are needed.
● Use only open‑source libraries and tools.
● Include the following in your repo:
○ HTML, CSS, JavaScript or framework code
○ Provided protein PDB and ligand SDF files
○ Provided SILCS FragMaps (.map and .dx format)
○ A clean directory structure (e.g., /assets, /src, etc.)
You may develop using:
● Plain JavaScript
● Vue / React / Svelte
● TypeScript
Framework choice does not affect evaluation.
5. Deliverables
When finished, submit:
1. GitHub Repository URL
2. Live URL hosted at any free provider
3. README.md containing:
○ Project overview
○ Short scientific explanation
○ Instructions to run locally if hosting is not available.
○ Notes about design decisions or tradeoffs
Optional (nice to have):
● A short (1–2 min) walkthrough video highlighting the viewer features
● Suggestions for future improvements
6. Evaluation Criteria (100 points total)
Scientific Understanding – 25 points
4
● Clear, accurate explanation of system of interest and ligands being analyzed
● Correct interpretation of FragMaps and their relevance
Technical Implementation – 45 points
● Viewer loads properly in browser
● FragMaps display cleanly
● Visualization controls work (toggle maps, switch ligands, iso‑value adjustment)
● Smooth user experience
Code Quality & Structure – 15 points
● Clean, readable organization
● Sensible file structure
● Appropriate comments
Documentation & Communication – 15 points
● Clear README
● Simple, intuitive navigation
● Clear narrative accompanying the visualization
Passing threshold: 75/100
7. Expected Time Commitment
Total expected effort: 8-12 hours
You may spread this over up to 14 days.
This is a prototype exercise, not a production application.
8. Questions & Support
We cannot debug your code for you, but we will clarify:
● FragMap formats
● The SILCS‑MC pose refinement file structure
● Data organization
Please email any questions you have before submitting.
